# Applied Data Science Capstone - Coursera
## All the completed Jupyter Notebooks and Python files for the Applied Data Science Capstone course on Coursera which is the final course in the Data Science Professional Certificate by IBM

This Capstone showcases all the skills we learnt in all the previous 9 courses as we work with data of SpaceX rocket launches and analyse specifically Falcon 9 launches.

They are numbered in order for ease of access. 
The files in order are:
- Data Collection
- Webscraping
- Data Wrangling
- Exploratory Data Analysis using SQL
- Exploratory Data Analysis through Data Visualisation
- Maps using Folium
- Plotly Dashboard
- Predictions using Machine Learning algorithms (and comparision of their accuracy)
    
Plotly Dashboard is presented as the python code file and rest are Jupyter Notebooks.
